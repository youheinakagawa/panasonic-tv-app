# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- [x] Implementing UPnP device discovery to find Panasonic TVs on the local network.
- [x] Creating a user interface for the remote control.
- [x] Setting up the IPC communication between the main process and renderer process.
- [x] Implementing basic TV control using DLNA/UPnP.

## Recent Changes
- [x] Created the basic Electron application structure.
- [x] Implemented UPnP device discovery using node-ssdp.
- [x] Created a user interface for the TV list and remote control.
- [x] Set up IPC communication for TV discovery and control.
- [x] Implemented TV power and volume control using DLNA/UPnP.
- [x] Added detailed TV information display.
- [x] Created a GitHub repository for the project.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Implement more TV control functions (e.g., channel change, input selection).
- [ ] Add support for smart TV features.
- [ ] Improve the user interface with more visual feedback.
- [ ] Add settings for customizing the application.

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- [x] Using node-ssdp for UPnP device discovery instead of node-upnp, as node-upnp does not provide device discovery functionality.
- [x] Using SOAP requests to control the TV through DLNA/UPnP.
- [x] Using a simple HTML/CSS interface for the remote control, which can be improved in the future.
- [x] Using GitHub for version control.
